# Elasticsearch Installation Script for Ubuntu

## ü§î What Does This Repository Do?
This project provides an automated Bash script to install Elasticsearch on an Ubuntu system. 
Elasticsearch is a powerful search engine used for:
- **Cybersecurity & SIEM** (Log analysis, threat hunting, security monitoring)
- **Data Searching** (Storing and quickly retrieving large amounts of data)
- **Application Performance Monitoring** (Observing application logs and system health)

If you're new to Elasticsearch or cybersecurity, this script helps you set up Elasticsearch **without needing to manually install everything.** 

## Prerequisites
- A machine running Ubuntu.
- `curl` and `wget` installed.
- User privileges to execute commands as `sudo`.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Download the script**
   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aromich-25/CyberSecurity-Elasticsearch-Setup/main/install_elasticsearch.sh
   ```

2. **Grant execution permission**
   ```bash
   chmod +x install_elasticsearch.sh
   ```

3. **Run the script**
   ```bash
   ./install_elasticsearch.sh
   ```

4. **Verify Elasticsearch status**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status elasticsearch.service
   ```

5. **Test if Elasticsearch is running**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "localhost:9200/"
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (For Beginners)
This script automates the Elasticsearch installation by:
1. **Updating** the system's package list (to ensure you get the latest software).
2. **Installing dependencies** (`apt-transport-https` & `wget` to securely download files).
3. **Adding Elasticsearch‚Äôs official repository** (so Ubuntu knows where to download Elasticsearch from).
4. **Installing Elasticsearch** (pulling the latest version and setting it up).
5. **Configuring Elasticsearch to start automatically** when the system boots.
6. **Verifying installation** using system commands and a test request.

After running this script, **Elasticsearch will be running on your system!** üéâ

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues
**1Ô∏è‚É£ Error: "command not found" when running the script**
   - Make sure you added execution permissions:  
     ```bash
     chmod +x install_elasticsearch.sh
     ```

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Error: "Elasticsearch failed to start"**
   - Run this to check logs:  
     ```bash
     sudo journalctl -u elasticsearch --no-pager | tail -50
     ```
   - Ensure your system has at least **2GB RAM** (Elasticsearch requires memory to run).

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Error: "curl command not found"**
   - Install `curl` with:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install curl -y
     ```

## Notes
- The script installs the latest version of Elasticsearch from the official Elastic repository.
- Ensure your system has internet access for downloading dependencies.
- You may need to configure Elasticsearch further depending on your use case.
